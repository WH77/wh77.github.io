      Inspired by the riveting events of this week’s lab, I’ve decided to fill this space with ALU related creative writing instead of repurposing last week’s results/analysis section.

      The engineer was tired, with eyes like lead sheets. They looked away from their screen for a moment - the synthesis wasn’t going to mind either way. And for a brief moment, they let themselves look elsewhere. Perhaps they would’ve been better off writing penguin erotica than their own assembly instruction set. It was unclear which would be worth more, after all.

      Deadlines were in tatters all around the lab. Every man, woman, and rodent in the building was killing themselves trying to keep up. There was one exception - a bright young intern recently discovered a way to overcome the nets set up around the roof. The engineer shook the thought out of their mind - the synthesis would finish soon, and there weren’t any interns left to pick up the slack. With a sigh, the engineer copied over the last coefficient file. Unlike the others, at least this intern took care of their work before leaving.

      The PYNQ board shined weakly beside the hazy glow of the Vivado VIO pane. With each press of BTN1, another instruction was let out into the world by the program counter, to be devoured by the instruction decoder, to be mangled and processed by the ALU, regfile, and memory units. Each instruction left a small mark on the VIO pane - the engineer carefully screenshotting each one, all while trying to keep the intern’s smile out of their mind. Eventually, thankfully, the test came to an end. To the very last instruction, not a single screenshot looked wrong. The engineer smiled ever so slightly, as they prepared to disconnect the board. Then, out of primal debugging instinct, the engineer pressed BTN1 one last time - and saw that the output was not as expected. Tears came out, as though they were there all along.

      “There is a mysterious ritual that dates back thousands of years. No living creature has survived it except the penguin. They have wings but cannot fly. They're birds that think they're fish. And every year, they embark on a nearly impossible journey to find a mate. For twenty days and twenty nights the emperor penguin will march to a place so extreme it supports no other life. In the harshest place on Earth, love finds a way.”
